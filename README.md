# COMP6248-Reproducability-Challenge
In response to the reproduction challenge proposed by AI International Conference on Representation Learning (ICLR) paper, this report selects ”U-GAT-IT: UNSUPERVISED GENERATIVE ATTENTIONAL NETWORKS WITH ADAPTIVE LAYERINSTANCE NORMALIZATION FOR IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION” published in 2020 as reproduction object. After our team ex-
perimented with different datasets compared with the baseline model CycleGAN1, the results of this report is that the overall performance of U-GAT-IT is consistent
with their paper’s views.

This Reproducability work is based on U-GAT-IT model. U-GAT-IT consists of two generators and two discriminators. A generator and a discriminator form a group for training, in which the attention module and AdaLIN are embedded for auxiliary functions. One group is for training selfie to anime and other group is for training
anime to selfie
