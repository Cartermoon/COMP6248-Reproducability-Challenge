# COMP6248-Reproducability-Challenge
In response to the reproduction challenge proposed by AI International Conference on Representation Learning (ICLR) paper, this report selects ”U-GAT-IT: UNSUPERVISED GENERATIVE ATTENTIONAL NETWORKS WITH ADAPTIVE LAYERINSTANCE NORMALIZATION FOR IMAGE-TO-IMAGE TRANSLATION” published in 2020 as reproduction object. After our team ex-
perimented with different datasets compared with the baseline model CycleGAN1, the results of this report is that the overall performance of U-GAT-IT is consistent
with their paper’s views.
